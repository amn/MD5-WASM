# Overview

This repository offers a [WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org) (WASM) module implementing primitives for computing [MD5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) digests.

The module contains _a set_ of routines designed to be leveraged together in a wide number of settings and applications -- instead of providing a single routine which could be an impediment to use with some types of data or framework.

The module will have been "written in WebAssembly" -- using the [canonical] [WAT text format](http://webassembly.org/docs/text-format), with or without use of pre-compiler as well. Generally this is for assessing optimization avenues and to retain ability to easily introspect the implementation, as compiling from a sufficiently different language may or may not generate "readable" WASM/WAT code. That said, multiple implementations may be temporally contained within the repository, and possibilities of _generated_ WAT code (or WASM code generated by a compiler indeed) are not excluded.

Releases containing the built module may be made available through the ["Releases"](http://github.com/amn/MD5.wasm/releases) feature, eventually, for convenience.

There is the [MD5.js](http://github.com/amn/MD5.js) module that uses this module to facilitate MD5 computation with e.g. a Web browser.

# Installation

The module that you can load for immediate use by a WASM virtual machine (e.g. in your Web browser), is built from source code in this repository. This building of the WASM module is encapsulated by the provided `makefile`. Change to the directory where you want the module file built and use [GNU `make`](http://www.gnu.org/software/make) like so:

```
make -f /path/to/the/makefile
```

To build the module you will need the following programs available at the build site:

* `wat2wasm`; here tested with v. `1.0.26` from the [WebAssembly Binary Toolkit](http://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt) (WABT)
* `m4`; here tested with v. `1.4.18` from the [GNU M4 preprocessor](http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/)
